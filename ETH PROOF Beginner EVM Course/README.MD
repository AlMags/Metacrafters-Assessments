# Project Title

ETH PROOF: Beginner EVM Course Assessment
"Getting Started with Solidity"

## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

This assessment tasked us to theoretically create our own token. Along with some requirements to 
guide us on what should be seen in the program. 

## Getting Started

The program was created using Solidity in the remix IDE. For keeping things simple, the class name
for the token is "MyToken" which has the following public variables of "TokenName", "tokenAbbr", and 
"totalSupply". This is also followed by the mint and burn functions that were required in the assessment.

### Installing

* You may use the same IDE (remix IDE) in order to have the program run properly.
* No modifications needed for the folder or the code.

### Executing program

* How to run the program
* Step-by-step bullets
```
- Copy and paste the script into the remix IDE or any IDE to run Solidity.
- Compile and deploy. 
- Copy your account address and paste it into the _address fields of the burn function, mint function, and 
  the balances field.
- After pasting the account address, you may mint a value by typing it into the _value field 
  then check if the mint function worked by clicking the totalSupply button
- You may also burn by adding a value to the _value field of the burn function. You may check again by clicking 
  the totalSupply button to check if the supply was transacted with.
- You may also check on the information of the token by clicking on the tokenAbbr and TokenName to get the
  token abbreviation and the token name respectively. However, if the value to burn is greater than the supply
  it will remain at 0.
